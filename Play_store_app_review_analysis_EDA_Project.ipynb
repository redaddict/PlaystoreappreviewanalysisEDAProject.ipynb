        "Identifying outliers: Heatmaps are also useful for identifying outliers or anomalies in data. Outliers are values that are significantly different from the rest of the data. Heatmaps can quickly highlight these values because they will stand out as different colors from the rest of the data.\n",

        "Comparing variables: Heatmaps can be used to compare variables and their relationships with each other. By creating a heatmap that shows the correlation between two or more variables, you can easily see how they are related to each other.\n",
